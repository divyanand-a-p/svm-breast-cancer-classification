# svm-breast-cancer-classification
Used SVM with linear and RBF kernels to classify breast cancer data.  
The dataset was scaled, and PCA was applied for 2D visualization.  
Hyperparameters C and gamma were tuned using a grid search.  
Decision boundaries were plotted for RBF kernel using projected features.  
RBF kernel gave better accuracy and handled non-linearity well.
